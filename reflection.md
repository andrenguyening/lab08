# Reflection
## What roles does HTML page have in web apps?
HTML pages provide information on how webpages should be structured and displayed. It uses elements structured in a hierarchical order. This is how the content is presented on a webpage. HTML pages provide the fundamental framework for user interfaces.
## Why do we need to use templating systems (e.g., Jinja2)?
Templating systems allow us to modularly reuse and implement code to dynamically generate HTML code to render. Imagine we want to display a list of cards. Templating allows us to repeatedly generate items in the list dynamically rather than going into an HTML page and typing the HTML structure for a list item every time there is a new item.
